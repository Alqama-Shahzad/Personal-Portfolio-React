# Design Document

## Overview

The solution addresses localStorage hydration issues that prevent projects from displaying on Netlify by implementing a safe localStorage pattern with proper SSR handling and error boundaries. The design ensures consistent project display across development and production environments.

## Architecture

### Current Problem Analysis
- `localStorage` is accessed immediately in `useEffect` without checking availability
- No error handling for JSON parsing failures
- Server-side rendering creates hydration mismatches
- Build process may encounter localStorage access attempts

### Solution Architecture
- Implement safe localStorage utilities with availability checks
- Add proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Use consistent initial state to prevent hydration mismatches
- Separate client-side localStorage logic from server-side rendering

## Components and Interfaces

### Safe Storage Utility
```typescript
interface SafeStorage {
  getItem<T>(key: string, defaultValue: T): T;
  setItem<T>(key: string, value: T): void;
  isAvailable(): boolean;
}
```

### Updated ProjectsSection Component
- Remove direct localStorage access from useEffect
- Implement safe storage pattern
- Add error boundaries for JSON parsing
- Maintain consistent initial state

## Data Models

### Project Data Flow
1. **Initial State**: Always start with `defaultProjects` array
2. **Client Hydration**: Safely attempt to read from localStorage after component mounts
3. **Fallback Strategy**: Use default data if localStorage is unavailable or corrupted
4. **State Management**: Update state only after successful localStorage read

## Error Handling

### localStorage Availability
- Check `typeof Storage !== 'undefined'` before access
- Wrap localStorage calls in try-catch blocks
- Provide meaningful fallbacks for all failure scenarios

### JSON Parsing Errors
- Catch `JSON.parse()` exceptions
- Log errors for debugging without breaking functionality
- Fall back to default data on parsing failures

### Hydration Mismatch Prevention
- Use consistent initial state between server and client
- Defer localStorage reads until after initial render
- Implement loading states if necessary

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test safe storage utility functions
- Verify error handling for various failure scenarios
- Test component behavior with and without localStorage

### Integration Tests
- Test full component lifecycle with localStorage
- Verify fallback behavior when localStorage is unavailable
- Test hydration consistency

### Production Validation
- Deploy to staging environment that mimics Netlify
- Verify projects display correctly on first load
- Test localStorage functionality in production build
