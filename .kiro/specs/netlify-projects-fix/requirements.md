# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The portfolio website shows projects correctly on localhost during development but fails to display projects when deployed to Netlify. This issue stems from localStorage hydration problems and server-side rendering incompatibilities that cause the projects array to become empty in production.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the deployed portfolio website, I want to see all projects displayed correctly, so that I can view the developer's work and skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the website loads on Netlify THEN the system SHALL display all projects from the default projects array
2. WHEN localStorage is empty or unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to the default projects data
3. WHEN the page hydrates in the browser THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent project display without flickering

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the localStorage functionality to work correctly without breaking the production build, so that any future project management features work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN localStorage is available THEN the system SHALL safely read and write project data
2. WHEN localStorage is not available (SSR/build time) THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the absence without errors
3. WHEN there are JSON parsing errors from localStorage THEN the system SHALL catch errors and fall back to default data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to complete successfully on Netlify, so that the website deploys without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL not attempt to access localStorage during build time
2. WHEN the component renders server-side THEN the system SHALL use default projects data consistently
3. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL generate static files with projects pre-rendered
